# Personalized jenkins experience

Jenkins web ui can be slow. This app is faster, as maintains job listing offline

Features:

- 'jenq sync' fetches job list from server
- 'jenq jobs foobar-*-build' lists matching jobs
- 'jenq fav JOBNAME' favorites JOBNAME
- 'jenq favs' lists last 5 build statuses for all your favs
- 'jenq log JOBNAME' outputs last build console output to console

Todo:

- Angular 2 UI
- Other stuff I use
